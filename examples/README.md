# OpenVariant's examples

In order to be able to run the different examples, you need to install __OpenVariant__. 
Also, it is recommended to use your favourite Python environment to avoid any kind of versioning problem.  

On this folder you have different [Jupiter Notebook](<https://jupyter.org/>) that will allow you to know how 
__OpenVariant__ works. Separated o different directories you will find: 

- [Find files examples](./find_files)
- [Variant examples](./variant)
- [Task examples](./tasks)
- [Command-line interface examples](./cli)
- [Plugin system examples](./plugin_system)
- [Datasets](./datasets) - this the data that all examples will use to parse and analyse.
