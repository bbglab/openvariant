Getting started
===============================

**OpenVariant** is a comprehensive package to parse and operate different input file formats in a customized way.
Its aim is being able to manage a ton of data represented in multiple ways and be able to build an unified output with
a proper `annotation` file structure. This package was thought not only to work with biological data, also, it can be used
for any kind of data that can be represented as a table.

**OpenVariant** offers a toolkit to transform and operate the parsed input data. Through this :ref:`User guide` you
will be able to do a walk-through of all its different functionalities. Even so, one of the main things of **OpenVariant**
is the annotation structure which the package is based. This kind of annotation structure will describe how input files
will be parsed and how the output will be represented. It is important to know how it works and how it is composed,
in order to manage data in the best way possible and later on perform a decent analysis. In the following section
you will learn how the annotation files have to be built and what are the key factors to get the most out.

For deeper detail of how it works and which are the actions that you can perform, take a look into :ref:`Tasks` and
:ref:`Command-line interface` sections. In addition, for more advance features, check: :ref:`Plugin system`.
If you want to try out or have some doubts on how to set it up, check our :ref:`Installation` section and take a look
into the multiple :ref:`Examples` that we built. In case that you want to be engaged and contribute to the project,
